# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) and
this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Unreleased

### Fixed
- Homebrew cask SHA-256 mismatch after macOS code signing replaces release
  archive. Extracted cask publishing from `sign-macos` into a dedicated
  `publish-cask` job that computes the SHA from the final release artifact,
  eliminating the TOCTOU gap between signing and cask publication.
  (Fixes [#81](https://github.com/unbound-force/replicator/issues/81))

### Added
- SECURITY.md with vulnerability reporting policy (GitHub Security
  Advisories preferred, email fallback)
- CODEOWNERS for governance file protection
- Dependabot configuration for automated weekly dependency update PRs
  for Go modules and GitHub Actions
- `govulncheck` security scanning in CI pipeline (pinned to v1.5.0)
- Per-package coverage ratchets in CI with 11 package thresholds
- `make coverage` and `make check-coverage` Makefile targets for
  local coverage enforcement before pushing
- CI convention pack (`ci.md`) for workflow standards
- CLAUDE.md for automatic convention pack loading in Claude Code
- New agentkit slash commands scaffolded by `replicator init`:
  `/forge`, `/forge:status`, `/org`, `/inbox`, `/handoff`
- New agentkit agents: `coordinator`, `worker`, `background-worker`
- New agentkit skills: `always-on-guidance`, `forge-coordination`,
  `forge-global`, `learning-systems`, `replicator-cli`,
  `system-design`, `testing-patterns`

### Changed
- Release pipeline now uses shared org-infra reusable workflows for
  preflight validation and GoReleaser execution. Releases gain supply
  chain artifacts (cosign signatures, SBOMs), smarter re-run resilience,
  and semver ordering validation. GoReleaser config gains
  `release.extra_files` for Homebrew cask upload. macOS code signing
  and notarization stays inline.
  (Part of unbound-force/unbound-force#428)
- Slash commands migrated to `uf.*` namespace (e.g., `/unleash` is
  now `/uf.unleash`, `/cobalt-crush` is now `/uf.cobalt-crush`)

### Security
- Go bumped to 1.25.12 for crypto/tls vulnerability fix
- All CI actions and reusable workflows pinned to commit SHAs for
  supply chain integrity (`actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-go`,
  `complytime/org-infra`, `govulncheck`)
